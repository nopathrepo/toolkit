### oberon.py ###
This program will check each line in each file in a specified directory to see if the lines exceed
a specified amount of characters. This is especially useful if you are limited to a specific number
of characters per line (such as in a university classroom). 

C/C++ Specific:
oberon.py also supports header guard checking (#pragma once and #ifndef) and allows the user to
customize the header guard with name, date, username, etc. for all files in a directory.

## How to Use ##
To run Oberon, type:
  "python oberon.py"
into your terminal.

Oberon is written in Python 3 but does work and has been tested with Python 2.
